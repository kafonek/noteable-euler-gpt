# Contributing Guidelines

If you want to add new Notebooks to this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Notebook**: The name of the notebook should include the problem number with leading zeros. This ensures that a string search shows problem 0001 before 1000.

2. **Solve the Problem**: Write markdown and code in the Notebook to solve the challenge. Make sure to add comments that talk to any of the learning points listed in the README.

3. (Future feature -- do not try this yet) **Update the Changelog**: Once the Notebook has run and provided a solution, update the Unreleased section of the CHANGELOG. Mention that the solution number has been solved. If applicable, add up to three one-sentence sub-bullets highlighting what lessons learned from the README are prominent in this solution.

4. **Shut Down the Kernel**: After you're done solving the challenge, shut down the Kernel for the Notebook. This helps to free up resources for other tasks.
